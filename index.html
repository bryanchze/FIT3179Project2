          <p><br>Happiness is when one is in a state of well-being and contentment
            in what they are doing or in life in general. If that is the case,
            then it comes to no suprise that happiness varies in different
            countries in the world. The United Nations supplies articles and
            rankings of the happiness of each country based on the ratings of
            respondent’s lives correlating with various quality of life
            factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social
            security, freedom to make choices, generosity of the population,
            health expectancy and perceptions of corruption. The happiness rank and 
            scores of each countries based on the World Happiness report can be explored on
            the map below.

          <p>The world average happiness score stayed close 
            over the past 5 years with very slight fluctuations in 2017 and 2019 and cannot be
            considered significant because it is very small. Therefore, we can 
            conclude that the average world happiness level did not drastically change over 2015-2019.
            <br><br>Here, we observe the difference on the happiness score as 
            well as the factors that affects happiness over time between 
            different regions. 
            On average, <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b> has the highest average happiness score
            every year, hence explaining <b>Oceania</b> having the highest average scores for all

          <p><br>We can see that most of the countries in the top 10 are located in 
            <b>Europe</b>. There are three regions that are in the top 10 happiest countries in the world which are
            <b>Europe</b>, <b>North America</b> and <b>Ocenia</b>. At the country level, we can see that there are some fluctuations in the rankings
            from year to year. However, if we look at the rankings by region, we can observe that
            every year the regions in which the happiest countries are located has not really change much which solidifies the evidence to the happiness
            in these particular regions. If we were to compare to the least happiness countries, we will see that they would
            have almost twice the number of countries during the same period, mostly located in Africa.  
            <br><br>Finland has been the worlds happiest country in 2018 and 2019
            which makes them a good country for an in-depth happiness research on maintaining the happiness of
            people. Moreover, we can also see that Netherlands had also been on the list, 
            gradually moving from 7th place in 2015 to the 5th place in 2019.

          <p>Similar to the previous section, but we will now go deeper to see the difference
            between the happiness scores between coutnries over time. Although the world happiness 
          average did no change much, we can observe that there's a significant difference between the 
        countries when it come to the happiness score. <br><br> In 2019, the difference between the highest
      and lowest score was of <b>4.9 points</b>. And we can see that this difference is actually <b>increasing</b> through the years.</p>

          <p>Lastly, in order to help us understand what might influence the behaviour of
            happiness scores, we present scatterplots of five main factors against the 
            happiness score to see if there is any correlation between these factors with the 
            happiness score. We can see that the factors that most influences happiness are
            <b>economy</b>, <b>family support</b>, <b>health</b> as well as <b>freedom to make life choices</b>, whereas
            the trust in the government does not show much of an incluence to happiness. 
            So, there is no doubt that the factors measured in the World Happiness 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="description description-right">
          <p>Report contributes significantly
            to our individual happiness. However, we should also take into consideration on other factors that 
            could possibly be at play. For example, the sustainable development goals that was designed to
            improve the live of people on Earth such as no poverty, quality education, affordable and clean
            energy and many more. Therefore, these factors might also need to be looked into in regions that are 
            unhappy in order to understand the reason behind it.
